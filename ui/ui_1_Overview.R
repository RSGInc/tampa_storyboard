In part, this work will seek to define what questions these data can and cannot answer. Our proposed analysis will aim to document the changes that have occurred and inform future data collection needs, while perhaps helping to refine policy focus. Some questions that might be answered by this analysis include: What new challenges have arisen as a result of COVID-19? What previous challenges may be less pressing today? How have trends tracked for years before COVID-19 been impacted? Are they accelerated, dampened, or reversed? During the course of this work, RSG will coordinate with FDOT staff to identify and develop additional questions of interest.The analysis will produce origin-destination trip tables for trips to/from the Tampa Bay Region as a whole, as well as for specific geographic subarea locations such as Busch Gardens and Downtown Tampa.  Trip tables will be produced for Fall 2019 and Fall 2022 conditions, and will be segmented by day of week, time of day, general trip purpose categories, and trip maker classification (residents, workers who live outside the region/geographic subarea, and non-work-related visitors including tourists). RSG follows the latest developments in the mobility data analytics space and has evaluated multiple potential data products for this study to determine their strengths, limitations, and whether they could reliably answer FDOTâ€™s questions around visitor and worker travel patterns and demographics. RSG determined that a combination of data products was optimal, to leverage the benefits and fill in the gaps of the individual sources.RSG recommends the combination of Replica simulated travel pattern data with new mobility analytics data from location-based services (LBS) data sources. The Replica data source will provide RSG with detailed travel behavior and demographic data for trip making within the Florida, Georgia, and South Carolina megaregion, while the LBS data source will provide the home location and destination of visitors from locations within the United States. The two data sources will be combined to provide an updated look at not only visitor and worker travel, but all travel within, to, from, and through the Tampa Bay Region."

This survey studied household demographics, daily travel activities, and typical travel patterns throughout the five-county Tampa Bay region of Citrus, Hernando, Hillsborough, Pasco, and Pinellas counties.
